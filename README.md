## some important notes:
- Scrum is the leading agile development method for completing projects with a complex, innovative scope of work.
- A deliverable is a product or service produced or provided as part of a project.
- Agile means being able to move quickly and easily, but some people feel that project management, as they have seen it used, does not allow people to work quickly or easily.

# Three basic organizational structures
* Functional: functional managers report to the CEO.
* Project: program managers report to the CEO.
* Matrix: middle ground between functional and project structures; personnel often report to two or more bosses; structure can be weak, balanced, or strong matrix.
